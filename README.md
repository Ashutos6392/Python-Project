# Python-Project
# Carbon Emission Impact Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

#### This project explores the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions and global temperature changes using Python-based data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze trends, establish correlations, and predict future temperature changes based on CO₂ levels.

#### 📂 Dataset Used

- CO₂ Emission Data: Historical records of CO₂ emissions over time.

- Global Temperature Data: Annual temperature anomalies observed worldwide.

- Climate Indicators: Additional environmental parameters influencing climate change.

#### 🔍 Methodology

- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

- Handled missing values and formatted datasets for analysis.

- Standardized date formats and merged datasets for trend comparison.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized CO₂ emission trends and global temperature rise.

- Used line plots, scatter plots, and histograms to identify patterns.

- Correlation Analysis

- Pearson & Spearman correlation tests to measure relationships.

- Findings: Strong positive correlation (0.96) between CO₂ levels and temperature changes.

- Lagged Effect & Causality Testing

- Conducted Granger Causality Tests to determine if past CO₂ levels influence current temperatures.

- Analyzed lagged effects (1-3 years) to detect delayed climate responses.

- Clustering Analysis

- Applied K-Means Clustering to group years based on temperature anomalies and CO₂ levels.

- Identified climate trend patterns over decades.

- Predictive Modeling & Scenario Simulation

- Developed a Linear Regression Model to predict temperature changes based on CO₂ emissions.

- Simulated "What-if" scenarios:

-🔺 10% Increase in CO₂ → Significant temperature rise.

-🔻 20% Decrease in CO₂ → Notable cooling effect.

#### 📊 Key Findings

- ✔ CO₂ emissions are a direct driver of global warming.
- ✔ Even minor reductions in emissions can slow down climate change.
- ✔ Predictive models confirm that human intervention can reverse negative trends.
- ✔ Clustering analysis shows distinct periods of temperature anomalies linked to industrial activities.
